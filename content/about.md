I think a lot about what it means to be human<small><sup>[1](#foot1)</sup></small>.
The experience of being human has really changed throughout history, especially in the last few hundred years.
So, I am really interested in both

- what it means to be alive now, with the current events and such
- what it means to be alive generally: what are the things that humans do, and the thoughts that they have

What aspects of my experience of the world are innate to human consciousness? What issues do people have that are, just,
an inevitable consequence of life? What does it mean to be alive in the first place?

Compassion. A desire to fit in. A desire for companionship. For a purpose. To make a difference.
<!--- Contempt. Selfishness. Envy. Greed. -->

Thinking about what it means to be a person evokes a sense of community, and, like, patriotism with all humans?
I don't know. People are just great. 4.5 stars. We're all here, and we're all trying our best. Most of the time.

That's probably why Canon exists. Somewhere wrapped up in my feelings about the human experience 
is a want to write down some thoughts. Brains are fickle and forget things constantly. Recording thoughts enables 
easier sharing, with both others and future me<small><sup>[2](#foot2)</sup></small>. I'm the type of person who likes
to keep all sorts of metadata about myself. It's why I haven't turned off all the privacy-invading settings on my 
devices. Yes, please take my data. As long as you share it with me.

Canon is meant to be *my canon*. Authentic thoughts from the noggin. 
A reflection of the principles that I govern myself by. Recorded for posterity.

...

It's really just a blog, actually. Yeah, it's just my blog.

<a name="foot1">1</a>: Humans are unique in intelligent life, and unfortunately this means that we can't
separate what it means to be conscious with what it means to be human.

<a name="foot2">2</a>: Past me is an idiot. Why would I care what he has to say?
