I think a lot about something my brain has categorized as 'the human<small><sup>[1](#foot1)</sup></small> experience'.
What aspects of my experience of the world are innate to human consciousness? What
are the thought patterns that people share? What issues do I struggle with, that 
everyone else does as well? 

Compassion. Contempt. A desire to fit in. A desire for companionship. For a purpose. To make a difference.
<Comment>Selfishness. Envy. Greed.</Comment>

Thinking about what it means to be a person evokes a sense of community,
and, like, patriotism with all humans? We're all here, and we're all trying our best. Most of the time.

That's probably why Canon exists. Somewhere wrapped up in my examination of the human experience
(and examination of my own experience) is a desire to record my observations. Brains are fickle
and forget things constantly. They change over time and adapt to new situations. It's useful to
record what's going through mine, in case future me can glean some more insight<small><sup>[2](#foot2)</sup></small>.

Canon is meant to be *my canon*. Authentic thoughts from the noggin. 
A reflection of the principles that I govern myself by. Recorded for posterity.

...

It's really just a blog, actually. Yeah, it's just my blog.

<a name="foot1">1</a>: Humans are unique in intelligent life, and unfortunately this means that we can't
separate what it means to be conscious with what it means to be human.

<a name="foot2">2</a>: Past me is an idiot. Why would I care what he has to say?
