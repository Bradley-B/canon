Recipe originally from [budget bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/sheet-pan-bbq-meatloaf-dinner/).
It calls for 1/4 lb of beef per person, but for my tastes it's probably closer to 1/3 lb or 1/2 lb.
It's important to make mini-meatloafs of about 1/4 lb each to keep the outside from burning. The sweet 
potato and broccoli are technically optional but go well with the meatloaf. It's important to have a 
vegetable.
