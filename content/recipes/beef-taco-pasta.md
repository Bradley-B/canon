Recipe originally from [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/beef-taco-pasta/). I haven't 
gotten the spices exactly how I want yet, but this recipe is really just another "throw stuff in a pot 
with ground beef and pasta", so I'm not too torn up about it. If you're doubling the recipe, the proportions 
are also weird. I recommend not doubling the tomatoes and beef broth or else it's really watery.

Sometimes it's a challenge to get it to taste sufficiently unique from
[this goulash recipe](https://www.budgetbytes.com/goulash/). That one is pretty good too, though. So 
tasting like it isn't all that bad.
