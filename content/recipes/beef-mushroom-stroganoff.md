Recipe originally from [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/one-pot-beef-mushroom-stroganoff/).
Sometimes I double the recipe, but I don't really have cookware that's big enough so more often I just 
make it twice across a few days. I'm not a huge worcestershire sauce fan, so I sometimes replace it with 
oyster sauce or soy sauce. It doesn't make it taste oyster-y -- it's to add more umami. As if this recipe 
needs it with the beef & mushrooms, lol.
