Recipe originally from [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/southwest-chicken-skillet/). I made 
almost no modifications to this, except sometimes I make it with medium or short grain rice because I 
don't have long-grain. It's really good. Using the precooked chicken carcass from the store is nice, I don't 
have to deal with raw chicken, and I can split up the work by shredding it in advance.

### Staple Ingredients
- 1 cup long grain white rice
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 1 15oz can black beans, drained

### Special Ingredients
- 1 cup shredded mex cheese
- 2-3 green onions, chopped
- 1 cup salsa
- 1.5-2 cups precooked shredded chicken
- 1 3/4 chips chicken broth

### Instructions
- combine rice, salsa, chicken, black beans, chili powder, and chicken broth in a large skillet
- lid, bring to boil over high heat, then reduce to low and simmer for 15 min
- turn odd the heat, let rest with lid in place for 5 min
- remove lid, fluff w/ fork. add cheese, melt cheese. add green onion
