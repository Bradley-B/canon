Recipe originally from [Gimme Delicious](https://gimmedelicious.com/baked-chicken-parmesan/). Frying 
chicken is kinda stressful, and I often mess it up. It always comes out too oily or watery. This recipe 
doesn't have those problems, it's pretty good. The recipe calls for 1 tsp of salt, but I think that's a 
bit much (and I like salt). Maybe 1/2 a tsp is right.

### Staple Ingredients
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp salt
- pepper to taste
- 1 egg

### Special Ingredients
- 2 chicken breasts (~1 lb)
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese
- 1 cup marinara sauce
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella

### Instructions
- preheat oven to 425Â°F
- grease sheet pan with olive oil
- combine panko, parmesan, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper
- whisk egg in small bowl
- slice chicken breasts in half, pound to even thickness
- dip chicken into egg, then panko mixture. Transfer to baking sheet
- bake for 15 min
- flip, top with 3-4 tbsp of marinara sauce and a bunch of mozz cheese
- return to oven and bake 5-7 minutes or until chicken is cooked through
- brown under broiler for a couple minutes if desired
