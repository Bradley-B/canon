## Recipe #1

Makes two pizzas. The quick rise at room temp is nice if you don't want to pre-make the dough, but the taste
is only *pretty good*, not quite developed to where I want it.

### Staple Ingredients
- 1 tbsp granulated sugar
- 1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast
- 3+ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

### Special Ingredients
- mozzarella cheese
- pizza sauce
- other toppings if desired

### Instructions
- bloom yeast. mix remaining staple ingredients
- knead until elastic and only slightly tacky, 5 min
- place into oiled bowl and rise about 1.5 hours, until doubled in size
- divide dough in half, preheat oven to 500Â°F
- make pizza
- bake 12-15 minutes
