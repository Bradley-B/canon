## Recipe #2

Makes four pizzas. I'm on board with making the dough in advance, even if just to break up the work into 
separate days. I think it turned out better tasting, and I was able to get it flatter than with Recipe #1. 
I don't care to do a taste test where I make both. I will probably go with Recipe #2 from now on.

After letting the dough rise in the fridge for 4 days, it was tasty and still workable. After 6 days, it 
took on a very noticeable alcohol smell (like, headache-inducing) due to the fermentation. Dough was tasty,
of course, but I found it harder to work with. I would say that 6 days is too long. After 7 days, I made 
the last of the dough into bread, which was delicious. Would do it again.

Next time I want to try shredding the cheese myself (and maybe using a baking steel), but I'm having 
trouble finding a grocery store that sells block mozzarella in low moisture, whole milk form.

### Staple Ingredients
- 2 1/4 cup water
- 1 tbsp granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp yeast + more if you want it yeasty
- 5 cups bread flour
- 1 tbsp kosher salt

- make pizza
- bake until done

## Recipe #1

Makes two pizzas. The quick rise at room temp is nice if you don't want to pre-make the dough, but the taste
is only *pretty good*, not quite developed to where I want it.

### Staple Ingredients
- 1 tbsp granulated sugar
- 1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast
- 3+ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

### Special Ingredients
- mozzarella cheese
- pizza sauce
- other toppings if desired

### Instructions
- bloom yeast. mix remaining staple ingredients
- knead until elastic and only slightly tacky, 5 min
- place into oiled bowl and rise about 1.5 hours, until doubled in size
- divide dough in half, preheat oven to 500Â°F
- make pizza
- bake 12-15 minutes
