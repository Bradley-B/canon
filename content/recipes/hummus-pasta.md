Recipe originally from [this savory vegan](https://www.thissavoryvegan.com/one-pot-creamy-hummus-pasta/).
I have a bunch of modifications to this one. Although technically "one pot", it's not really in the 
spirit of "one pot" as you need to transfer the pasta to/from a colander to drain it after cooking. The next 
time I make this, I want to play around with replacing the water with stock and using the exact right 
amount, so it doesn't need to be drained. It's also not really one pot unless you cook the chicken serially.

Forget to break the linguine in half at your own peril. Using unbroken linguine makes it literally
impossible to stir in the hummus and other finishing ingredients. If using one pot, do yourself a favor and 
use a tall skillet over a pot. You may be tempted to use a pot because that's what you cook pasta in. 
That's the devil talking.

I vastly prefer linguine to spaghetti for this. The sriracha + hummus combo is by far the best part, do NOT 
skip the sriracha or skimp on it.
