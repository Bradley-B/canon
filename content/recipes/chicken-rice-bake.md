Recipe originally from [Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntd_Y2eywc4). I don't think I've 
ever actually used the herbs de provence this calls for, I just add some italian seasoning or whatever. 
The fresh squeezed lemon at the end is my favorite part. I usually cut up the chicken before browning 
instead of after - you get less browned flavor, but I find it annoying to cut up all the hot & oily chicken
into bite sized pieces.

### Staple Ingredients
- 2 cups long or medium grain white rice
- 2 tsp herbs de provence or other poultry friendly herbs

- roughly chop onion
- transfer browned chicken to plate, add onion to pot
- chop carrots into bite size pieces, add to the pot
- add rice to the pot, let it toast for a minute
- if you don't have an oven safe pot, transfer everything to a big baking dish
- pour in chicken stock, chicken, salt & pepper, spices, etc.
- bake covered for 20-30 minutes or until the rice has absorbed all the moisture
- after baking, stir in frozen peas. serve with lemon wedge for squeezing
