In the wake of the [mushroom stroganoff incident](../posts/sands-of-time) I started keeping more plaintext 
backups of recipes, mostly in Google Keep. Given [Google's history of killing things](https://killedbygoogle.com/),
this was probably not a great idea, but whatever. When I needed to reference a recipe, I would open the 
note on my phone in the kitchen, and read it there.

Instead of Google Keep, I've played around with different recipe apps, but didn't really like any of them. I 
was always like 'eh, one day I'll just make one that does what I want'. Well, it's finally time to make the 
thing that does what I want. As I've done more home cooking in the last few years, I think I have enough 
experience that I can tell what would be useful, and what would be superfluous. The perfect app? Yeah, just 
put it on my blog.

I swear, it's not just me being lazy. Probably. Actually, I think the killer app isn't an app at all,
it's a laminated recipe book. No dealing with getting food on your precious technology - the phone stays 
in another room, FAR AWAY from all the flour and cornstarch that gets everywhere. Earbuds can reach from 
a ways away, and have touch controls on them. The reason I need a digital recipe presence *at all* is really 
just for backups. That laminated recipe book is rather prone to getting lost, damaged, stolen, etc. With a 
backup source that I control, I can easily do something like generate a pdf of all my stored recipes. It's 
also nice for sharing with others, as I can send them a link that I know works (and isn't an ad-ridden 
mess ðŸ¤¢) instead of emailing it or sharing on Google Drive or using some other annoying format. I can also 
add any notes I have to the recipe without fear of ~pick: running out of space/not being able to read my 
handwriting~.

So, there you have it. To summarize, by storing recipes on my blog, I get:
- easy backups
- easy sharing
- easy to add content
- easy to add notes later

Works for me! I'll start adding things here as I make them.
