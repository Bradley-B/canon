Recipe originally from [Masala and Chai](https://masalaandchai.com/whole-roasted-tandoori-chicken/) with modifications from Jai Mehra and myself.
Note that it requires a 24 hour marinade but is otherwise easy.

Astute readers may notice that the recipe says to bake for 20 min and then broil for 3. This is because the first time I made this, I tried to cook it by broiling (no baking), and I almost started a fire. Likely skill issue. I do think it turns out better if you cook it by broiling instead of baking, but I don't want to be held responsible for that.

### Modifications
- from me: the recipe is for a whole chicken. I have never done this since it is too much work, I just use the marinade with chicken thighs
- from Jai: instead of the Kashmiri chili powder, cumin, and turmeric, he uses a premade TOOBA Chicken Tikka mix. I have no idea if it would be better with the original spices. This is good too.

### Spicy Notes
For spicy, use 2 tbsp of the spice mix (less than one packet). For less spicy, use 1 tbsp. For more spicy, use more or the whole packet (I have never done this, do this at your own risk).

### Staple Ingredients
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1.5 tsp garam masala
- 1/2 tsp ground green cardamom
- 1 tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil or mayo
- 2 tbsp TOOBA Chicken Tikka mix

### Special Ingredients
- chicken thighs, maybe 2 lbs ish
- 1/2 cup whole milk yogurt (one little container)
- 1/2 lemon
- 2 tbsp ginger garlic paste
- (optional) red onion, chopped cilantro

### Instructions
- The day before you want to eat
    - do the dry brine if you want. Rub chicken in lemon and a little salt and let sit for an hour
    - mix yogurt, oil, spices, ginger garlic paste. marinade for 24 hours in the fridge
- Undoh on four hundoh
- Once oven is preheated, put chicken thighs in oven for 20 ish min
- Put oven on broil for 3 ish min, maybe until there is some smoke ([fire means it's working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNTj05I4k5I&t=638s))
- Check that the chicken is done
- Make rice and/or vegetables if you want
- Do something with the red onion and chopped cilantro. Idk, I've never read that part of the recipe
- Enjoy
