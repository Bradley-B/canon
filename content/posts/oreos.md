Did you know that oreo cookies are dairy free? They're also (sort of) vegan. There's also a gluten-free oreo.

Seems odd that they would be dairy free, considering they're 'milk's favorite cookie'. The white stuff is, 
in fact, "creme" and not "cream". The FDA prohibits it from being called "cream" on account of the lack of 
dairy.

Anyway. This just goes to show, the humble Oreo is likely one of the greatest foodstuffs ever created. 
Launched over 100 years ago, Mondelez International sells billions of dollars worth of oreo cookies every 
year. From deep-fried to cookies-n-creamed, you would be hard-pressed to find an American worth their salt 
that's never eaten an oreo before. If you do find such a person, feed them an oreo, I'm sure they'll 
appreciate it.

This week, I have been eagerly and zealously consuming a family-sized pack of oreos. I'm sure this is a 
phenomenon that many of my dedicated readers will sympathize with. They're so good! The family pack was 
only like 30 cents more expensive, so, realistically, how could I not get it?

I've been dipping them in milk, as you do, and I've noticed something a bit odd about the experience. As I 
made my way through the clean dish cycle, I used two different containers as the dipping vessel. On 
separate occasions, I used a mug (tall and narrow) and a small dish-type-thing (short and wide). I feel, 
unmistakably, like the milk more effectively soaks into the oreos when you dip them vertically 
rather than horizontally. I feel so strongly about this that I'm prepared to make a hypothesis: dunking 
your oreo cookie vertically rather than horizontally results in a soggier oreo over the same amount of 
time spent submerged.

I know what you're thinking. Look. If I'm gonna eat a whole bunch of sugar, I'm gonna at least pay 
attention so that I can enjoy it. I feel like I'm not wrong on this. I was going to do a taste test, but 
then I had a better idea. If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right. Double-blind experiment, 
multiple control groups, the works. I'm thinking that it won't be too difficult to find some brave test 
subjects to help me eat oreos & milk. It's research, I promise. These oreos... I'm just... gathering data.

Experiment TBD.
