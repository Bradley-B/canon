This post started out as an explanation of my favorite games and why I like them,
but I quickly realized that all my favorite games have great soundtracks. This is
now a video game music appreciation post ðŸŽ‰

## Top 3 Game Soundtracks
- Celeste
- Pyre

## Celeste

Celeste is a game about climbing a mountain. It is one of the best games I have ever played.

## Pyre

In Pyre, you play as a humble *reader* banished to *the downside* for your crimes of literacy.
The trip from civilization is one way - there's no return.

No return... except by will of the *scribes*. The eight scribes are legends, revered as holy figures
by the exiles in the downside. How do you gain the favor of long departed gods? By proving your
worthiness in the *rites*.

What are the *rites*? Well, basically, they involve playing a game. A competition.
A game about teamwork, determination, and sacrifice.
A game about plunging the *celestial orb* into your opponent's *pyre*.
A game not entirely unlike basketball.

Basketball about life and death.

The high-fantasy high-stakes environment crossed with the fact that you are
basically playing a sports game is an amusing and extremely engaging combination.
The phenomenal soundtrack from Darren Korb completes and immerses you in the
mystic atmosphere.
