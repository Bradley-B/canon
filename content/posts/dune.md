*~~~ This post contains spoilers for the first Dune book. It also assumes that you've read the book and 
        makes references that require you to know the whole the plot. Read ahead at your own risk ~~~* 

There's a lot of content in the first 600-odd pages of Frank Herbert's *Dune* series. While I don't yet
have a completely synthesized opinion, I feel like I want to talk a bit about the world and the characters 
that Herbert cultivates.

The first book of the *Dune* series is called *Dune* and is split up into three "books": Dune, Maud'Dib,
and The Prophet. To keep things from getting confusing I'm going to refer to the three "books" as
"parts". I don't know why they're called "books". This is possibly the thing I most dislike about Dune,
and it makes it very annoying to talk about, say, the second part of the first book.

## Mother and Son, Eternally at Odds

Throughout the book, Paul and Jessica routinely one-up each other in their superhuman abilities.
In his childhood, Jessica trained Paul in the Benne-Jesserit ways. Like her, he has truthsense, can
command people using the voice, and can fight exceptionally well, among other things. So far so good.
Early-on it's then revealed that *not only* does he have Benne-Jesserit powers, *but also* he is 
being trained to be a Mentat. So, at the start of the book, Paul is already poised at an intersection of
two of the pillars of their society, both of which you need to be specifically bred and trained for.

Jessica seems fine with this, as it's all according to her plan so far. She's happy when her son is
tested and is found Human. However, as soon as Paul starts to get some prescience from the spice, she's
pregnant with the daughter he was supposed to be. She then becomes a Reverend Mother. Not to be outdone,
Paul also takes the water of life and becomes the kwisatz haderach. 

I'm not sure if this is written as a conscious thing or not. The new abilities are really tied to their
character progression, so it does make sense to get them. It ultimately doesn't bother me that much, but
I did think it was amusing. Paired with the fact that Paul and Jessica can be at odds sometimes (Paul says
*my mother is my enemy* and Jessica notes how she has no compassion for Paul) and I did wonder if some
of their gain in abilities was to take a dig at the other.

## Style

One thing I liked about the style of the book was how they handled introducing new information to the
reader. Two big examples that stand out are the Liet-Kynes pieces and the Maker pieces. In both cases,
the final piece of information to be communicated (Liet is Kynes and The Worms Make The Spice / The Fremen
Ride The Worms) isn't exactly *told* to you. It would be easy to have a dialog between two characters where
Chani or whoever just goes 'hey. You should probably know. The worms make the spice'. Instead, the info
is drip-fed to you in small parts until you finally go 'ah, that's how it works'. Working it out is so
much more rewarding for the reader - it makes them feel clever, like they solved a puzzle.

## Appendixes

Dune includes a few appendix chapters with misc info, as well as a glossary of most of the made-up words.
This is cool for worldbuilding, I like it.

## The Dinner Party

Do people like this scene? For me, it dragged on a little long. I did enjoy the showcase of Jessica's
powers - the way she so easily reads everyone in the room, is able to predict what they all will say before
they say it. It shows Leto as maybe a bit unhinged, wasting all that good drinking water. All that *wealth*.
Calculated unhinged-ness.

These sorts of scenes are interesting from a plot point of view. Somehow, at the same time, nothing happens
but yet we learn so much about the characters involved. Ultimately, we never heard from most of the
people at this party again. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Kynes is important. Oh man, Kynes. They really went and killed the leader
of the Fremen. Does his death clear the way for Maud'Dib? Even while alive he was quoting legends in his
head about the Lisan al' Gaib. He probably would have accepted Paul and remained alive in a similar way
to Stilgar.

## The Coming Jihad

So for a long time Paul's main driving force is that he wants to prevent the holy war in his name. By
the end of the book, he doesn't seem to care anymore. What changed? Has he accepted that it will happen
regardless? Has he changed so much, gone mad with power? Becoming the Lisan al Gaib will do that
to you, I imagine. As will being able to see the future. Hmm. 

After the final battle, I think that Gurney notes to him that he appears to care more about the equipment
than the lives lost. Very un-Atrietes. Is he losing himself, his house's legacy? The Fremen have certainly
changed him. At this point, I might agree with Jessica in not really feeling compassion for him anymore.

## Jessica: The Last Reverend Mother

I think, when I read the Reverend Mother scene, I physically recoiled. In a good way, though. Like,
I put down the book, stood up, and started pacing, I was so excited. This is both a testament to
Herbert's good writing and also the fact that it's such a cool plotline. ALSO it's literally
Avatar: The Last Airbender. Hype as fuck. I wonder if the ATLA writers got some inspiration fron Dune.

I was trying to remember other pop culture references of the 'past lives' trope, but I
struggled to think of anything except avatar. I actually prefer the way Dune handles it - in Avatar,
you are born an Avatar and you get no say in the matter. I forget its name, but there's some spirit
that binds past avatars together and preserves their memories. New avatars are born when the old ones
die, so there is only ever one at the same time. In Dune, you need to take ownership of the memories,
they aren't just there when you're born. Granted, you need to be a Benne-Gesserit, but not all Benne-
Genserit are Reverend Mothers. The end result is the same, you get access to other people's
memories. I feel like Dune it's cooler - you instantly have access to the memories, and there's no
grappling with destiny, you know you're going to become a Reverend Mother. There's no conflict like
'uh no I don't want to be the avatar actually'.

This type of power is one of my favorite sci fi tropes. The Matrix sort of does it, on a less personal
level. Chills, dude. 

## Chani and Gender Roles

Alright, I'm gonna say it:

What's the point of Chani's character, other than to be Paul's loving acolyte? As the daughter of
Liet-Kynes, she was totally set up to be something more. I mean, the Fremen clearly respect her, and she appears
totally capable in handling herself, but after my first read I thought that she was mostly defined in terms of her
relationship to her father and to Paul. The plot points that she's involved in... *almost* do her character
justice? My knee-jerk reaction was that she needed a proper character arc of her own.

After thinking about it some more I think that she probably already has a good one that I just missed. 
There are a lot of characters, and there's over 600 pages of them all interacting with each other. It's
next to impossible to realize all of their roles in the first pass. I first read her as this cute gazelle
character to cheer up Paul and revive him. She gets some development after the Reverend Mother ceremony 
where she apparently gets some limited prescience and discovers that her true purpose in life is to have
a son with Paul üôÑ. She occasionally goes on mysterious missions, which we sometimes see the results of.
She disagrees with Paul, like, two or three times in the whole book, which leads to interesting discussions.
But what do these discussions build *to*? The ending of the book brought payoff for so many characters.
What did Chani get? A place by Paul's side as concubine. Great. Wanting what's best for Paul is one thing,
but it would be nice if she had her own ambitions too.

Does this property extend to other female characters? I don't know. I thought Jessica was great and
a well developed character. Mapes is a good throwaway character lol. Harah was alright too.
I would have liked some more content at the southern Seitch where Jessica, Chani, and their kids were
sent in the two-year interim.

## Alia

We've gotta talk about Alia. 
She is absolutely my favorite character in the whole book. A three-year old with the knowledge of a
hundred generations, putting the Emperor and his Truthsayer in their place. It's refreshing to have
a character that speaks their mind and doesn't speak in riddles. She isn't intimidated by Paul
(or by anyone), seems to actually surpass him in some abilities, and is willing to flaunt that
(unlike Jessica who honestly can be kinda dull). I hope that Alia gets a role in the later books and 
doesn't lose her wit and charm.

## Stilgar

I liked the Stilgar plotline and I was glad it was resolved peacefully. iirc coming up with the plan is
one of the finer moments of collaboration between characters. You know, it seems like it was a little too
easy, but whatever. There's power in patience. In coming up with a good plan, and sticking to it.

As a character, Stilgar comes a long way. It's the same guy that forms a testy alliance with Leto and accepts
Paul and Jessica into Seitch Tabr. The same guy that trains Paul in the Fremen ways for two years and dares
him to challenge him and take control of the Seitch. Still, there's a tinge of sadness by the end of the book
between Stil and Paul. By then, Stil really only views him as The Prophet. He quotes Fremen legends with
the Fedaykin whenever Paul so much as breathes. It's an interesting consequence that plays on the true 
destructive power of myth.

## Duncan Idaho, Gurney Hallek, and Thufir Hawat

In the first few part of the book I regularly mixed up who these three were. They're all introduced within
like a few chapters of each other and they all have similar roles. Loyal Atrietes men who helped train Paul.
The intricacies of their character differences are actually interesting, but I had difficulty with them
at first. It gets easier after one of them dies and they part ways after the betrayal. I knew that
Thufir thought that Jessica was the traitor, but I didn't realize that Gurney believed that as well.
This led to me being slightly confused when Gurney almost killed Jessica. I didn't go back and look, it was
probably mentioned but I missed it. It does make sense, he must have seen the Harkonnen note along with
Thufir and similarly believed it to be true.

Duncan was loyal to the end. To my surprise he seemed to actually have a smaller role in the book than
in the movie. Although, there was the whole drunk scene that wasn't in the movie. Hmm. Duncan dies knowing
it wasn't Jessica, right? I don't remember. In the first part I do remember thinking that his character
could totally be merged with Gurney, but knowing how everything turns out I admit that it's better for
them to be separate.

Gurney also remains loyal. He obviously just doesn't know that Paul lives and he just kinda chills with
the smugglers for 2-3 years until Paul collects him. Good for Paul to have someone from his past to
ground him. Shared history is important. At least Gurney doesn't join up with the Harkonnens, unlike
*some people*.  

Yeah, I mean Thufir. Did he redeem himself, in the end? I guess? He dies without killing Paul with the
Emperor's poison. While working for the Baron, he often thinks to himself how much he hates the Harkonnens,
but he never acts on it. Are we meant to think that it was him that raided the Seitch and killed little 
Leto? If so, he really did more harm than good. After discovering that Maud'Dib is Paul, he pledges
allegiance again, but I feel like it's too little too late considering he is actively dying from antidote
withdrawal. You could argue that he had no way to know. Still, joining forces with your (former?) House's
enemy is kinda not okay. He joins back up with the holy squad at the end. Not sold on him.

## Feyd-Rautha

Feyd-Rautha is a cool villain. Baron Harkonnen is, like, fine. Classic evil dude. His power comes from
money in his CHOAM shares, I think. He can't come up with schemes on his own, relying on Piter and 
Thufir to concoct them for him. He's totally disgusting. His redemption comes in the form of not
immediately killing his successor when an attempt is made on his own life. He dies with little fanfare to
best girl Alia.

Feyd-Rautha similarly has few redeeming qualities, but at least he's evil in style. He's got a head on
his shoulders, especially seen in the final battle. I think what I like most about Feyd-Rautha is how he
is juxtaposed against Paul. Both are characters rising to power in the book, but the way they do it is totally
different. Feyd-Rautha inherits the Harkonnen throne. His gladiator fights are rigged. He doesn't even
have the balls to kill his uncle himself. Paul loses everything, and fights tooth and nail for it back.
This makes Paul far more likable. Both are willing to do anything to get what they want, but as an Atrietes,
Paul seems to have more honor. 

In their final battle, Paul proves that he and Feyd-Rautha are different, despite their common ancestry. 
Where Feyd-Rautha has chosen to use a safe word in the same position, Paul retains his honor and
emerges victorious for it.

Since finding out he was a Harkonnen, I think this weighed on Paul. He has Harkonnen and Atrietes blood,
and he grapples with what that means. With the Harkonnens dead, maybe he can resolve some of his
inner turmoil.

## Visions of an Empire

In many ways, Dune is a tale of overconfidence. Overconfidence of the Atreities, knowing that a trap
was set but jumping into it anyway. Overconfidence of the Benne-Geserit, asserting that they could
bend the will of the Kwisach Haderach. Overconfidence of the Emperor, believing that he could fling 
Great Houses like swords at each other with no consequence to himself. Overconfidence of the Sardukkar,
unable to accept that they might lose in battle. Overconfidence of the Spacing Guild, with their hoards 
of money, blind to the possibility that Paul would destroy the spice. Overconfidence of Feyd-Rautha,
unaware of Maud'Dib's power and the weirding ways.

Overconfidence of the Fremen, believing that with a just cause they can't fail. I mean, they were right
in this case. But still overconfident imo.

That's how these stories go. Civilizations fall from overconfidence. Complacency leads to downfall. It's
been the way since before the Roman Empire, and it will be the way 10,000 years from now.

## Movie

Of course, the reason that I read *Dune* was that I loved the movie so much and couldn't wait a year
to find out what happens next. If you feel this way, I think it's worth it to read the book. I legitimately
enjoyed reading the part of the book the movie covered, because there's so much more to uncover in the plot
that the movie doesn't get to. I liked how in the book, the reader knows that Yueh is the traitor from 
the beginning. It creates tension with the characters. There were at least a couple points that I was
like 'is this it? is it happening??? üò≤' Jessica is so close to figuring it out! Knowing about the betrayal,
the payoff is still totally worth it. It's like in Romeo and Juliet - from the beginning, you the reader knows 
they both die at the end. It's still a good read.

--- 

If nothing else, the first *Dune* novel creates and sustains a deep and interesting world. The book
manages to hold the reader's attention in spite of its length, and it I look forward to reading more in the
series.
