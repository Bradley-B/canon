*~~~ This post contains spoilers for the first Dune book. It also assumes that you've read the book and 
        makes references that require you to know the whole the plot. Read ahead at your own risk ~~~* 

There's a lot of content in the first 600-odd pages of Frank Herbert's *Dune* series. While I don't yet
have a completely synthesized opinion, I feel like I want to talk a bit about the world and the characters 
that Herbert cultivates.

The first book of the *Dune* series is called *Dune* and is split up into three "books": Dune, Maud'Dib,
and The Prophet. To keep things from getting confusing I'm going to refer to the three "books" as
"parts". I don't know why they're called "books". This is possibly the thing I most dislike about Dune,
and it makes it very annoying to talk about, say, the second part of the first book.

The first part of the book establishes the characters and explains how Paul and Jessica, nobles of the
(former?) Great House Atrietes find themselves alone, wandering the desert with nothing more than the
bare essentials.

## Mother and Son, Eternally at Odds

Throughout the book, Paul and Jessica routinely one-up each other in their superhuman abilities.
In his childhood, Jessica trained Paul in the Benne-Jesserit ways. Like her, he has truthsense, can
command people using the voice, and can fight exceptionally well, among other things. So far so good.
Early-on it's then revealed that *not only* does he have Benne-Jesserit powers, *but also* he is 
being trained to be a Mentat. So, at the start of the book, Paul is already poised at an intersection of
two of the pillars of their society, both of which you need to be specifically bred and trained for.

Jessica seems fine with this, as it's all according to her plan so far. She's happy when her son is
tested and is found Human. <TODO the rest of this section>

I'm not sure if this is written as a conscious thing or not 

## Jessica: The Last Reverend Mother

oh my god it's avatar the last airbender

## Chani and Gender Roles

Alright, I'm gonna say it:

What's the point of Chani's character, other than to be Paul's loving acolyte? As the daughter of
Liet-Kynes, she was totally set up to be something more. I mean, the Fremen clearly respect her, and she appears
totally capable in handling herself, but after my first read I thought that she was mostly defined in terms of her
relationship to her father and to Paul. The plot points that she's involved in... *almost* do her character
justice? My knee-jerk reaction was that she needed a proper character arc of her own.

After thinking about it some more I think that she probably already has a good one that I just missed. 
There are a lot of characters, and there's over 600 pages of them all interacting with each other. It's
next to impossible to realize all of their roles in the first pass. I first read her as this cute gazelle
character to cheer up Paul and revive him. She gets some development after the Reverend Mother ceremony 
where she apparently gets some limited prescience and discovers that her true purpose in life is to have
a son with Paul ðŸ™„. She occasionally goes on mysterious missions, which we sometimes see the results of.
She disagrees with Paul, like, two or three times in the whole book, which leads to interesting discussions.
But what do these discussions build *to*? The ending of the book brought payoff for so many characters.
What did Chani get? A place by Paul's side as concubine. Great.

Does this property extend to other female characters? I don't know. I thought Jessica was great and
a well developed character. Mapes is a good throwaway character lol. Harah was alright too.
I would have liked some more content at the southern Seitch where Jessica, Chani, and their kids were
sent in the two-year interim.  

Alia is absolutely my favorite character in the whole book. A three-year old with the knowledge of a
hundred generations, putting the Emperor and his Truthsayer in their place. It's refreshing to have
a character that isn't totally intimidated by Paul, who seems to actually surpass him in some abilities
and is willing to flaunt that, unlike Jessica who honestly can be kinda dull. I hope that Alia gets a
role in the later books and doesn't lose her wit and charm.

## Stilgar

I liked the Stilgar plotline and I was glad it was resolved peacefully. iirc coming up with the plan is
one of the finer moments of collaboration between characters. You know, it seems like it was a little too
easy, but whatever. There's power in patience. In coming up with a good plan, and sticking to it.

As a character, Stilgar comes a long way. It's the same guy that forms a testy alliance with Leto and accepts
Paul and Jessica into Seitch Tabr. The same guy that trains Paul in the Fremen ways for two years and dares
him to challenge him and take control of the Seitch. Still, there's a tinge of sadness by the end of the book
between Stil and Paul. By then, Stil really only views him as The Prophet. He quotes Fremen legends with
the Feydakin whenever Paul so much as breathes. It's an interesting consequence that plays on the true 
destructive power of myth.

## Duncan Idaho, Gurney Hallek, and Thufir Hawat

## Movie

Of course, the reason that I read *Dune* was that I loved the movie so much and couldn't wait a year
to find out what happens next.

If nothing else, the first *Dune* novel creates and sustains an interesting world. The book manages to 
hold the reader's attention in spite of its length, and it I look forward to reading more in the
series.
