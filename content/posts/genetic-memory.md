Some of my favorite science fiction features genetic memory as a central plot device. The Benne Gesserit 
in *Dune*, the Goa'uld in *Stargate SG-1*, and even the Avatar in *Avatar: The Last Airbender* all share a 
common trait - they can access the memories of their ancestors. Aside from being cool as fuck, what makes 
genetic memory so interesting? Why does it resonate so deeply, and why is it always found in the coolest 
stories?

- if some of your memories live forever, do you ever really die?
  - you diverge from your child when you have one - you immediately start getting new memories they don't
  - sexual reproduction + genetic memory is complicated. merge conflicts? 
- Maybe we could stop making the same mistakes over and over again?

Maybe the allure of genetic memory comes from a less selfish place. I think one of the best parts of 
genetic memory is that we don't need to waste years and years getting new humans up to speed on where we 
are right now, just to have a chance of expanding our collective knowledge. Actually, never-mind expanding 
collective knowledge - it takes *forever* to even get to the point where new people can participate in 
*anything*. 

The gate to participate in pre-industrial society was presumably pretty low. I assume it was mostly around
physical strength - were you physically able to go farm, hunt, gather, etc. This took maybe a decade and
half before you were really up and contributing. Higher skill positions were likely on-the-job 
apprenticeships where people could be productive even as they were learning.

In post-industrial western society, the gate for participation is ever-increasing. The barriers are less 
physical and more cognitive. Unfortunately, it takes longer to learn advanced quantum mechanics from scratch 
then it does to get ripped. Of course, few people need to learn quantum mechanics. Still, it takes like 
10+ years until you can proficiently read, write, and build an adult-sized vocabulary - the minimum for 
participating in post-industrial society. It takes another

Think about all we could accomplish if new humans didn't need to waste 30 years faffing around before they 
could really get shit done. Imagine if the genetic memories extended to implicit memories! Babies 
come out of the womb already knowing how to juggle. Amazing. Without a doubt, society would look 
*drastically* different. Would families spend generations gaining specialized knowledge in one area, or 
would it be better to amass a bunch of different experiences in different fields?

All of a sudden, your experiences don't just affect you anymore. They affect your children, and your 
children's children, and their children... Your choice of partner is even more important, because 
you're choosing to merge all your memories with theirs.

No one wants anyone to be able to see their most embarrassing memories. Well, now all their descendents 
have them too. Fun. This could end up being a good thing; memories that elicit strong negative emotional 
reactions usually do that for a reason: to prevent you from being in that situation again.

It's easy to assume that genetic memory fixes all the startup costs of learning. On further reflection, 
however, I'm not convinced it's actually that beneficial for the 'expanding collective knowledge' angle. 
It's possible that the state-of-the-art just changes too often for it to be particularly useful. Let's say 
that every 30 years, a new human can get new memories from two parents. If both parents specialize in 
different fields, the child now has up-to-date information in two areas. However, the other areas have 
fallen by the wayside and are now out of date. Granted, the grandparents would have provided 
knowledge that is now 30 years old, and their parents would have provided knowledge that is now 60 years 
old, and their parents would have provided knowledge that is now 90 years out of date.

Take a look at this mspaint drawing illustrating the knowledge decay:

Best-case-scenario, the new child gets: up-to-date info for 2 fields, 30-year-old info for 4 fields,
60-year-old info for 8 fields, and 90-year-old info for 16 fields. I think it's safe to assume that after 
90 years the info stops being useful for advancing human knowledge. That cutoff is probably much sooner. 
Given how quickly current society is changing, it's really not practical to be a jack of all trades. I 
guess I've answered my question from before. With genetic memory, you need to go deep.

Even if families decide to specialize in one area instead of getting broad knowledge for a variety of 
topics, I feel like genetic memory still doesn't help that much. I mean, it's obviously useful to 
alleviate some startup costs. However, it only takes ONE generation to deviate from the family business 
before the info is 30+ years old and the benefit is pretty much negated. Additionally, when parents have 
children, they're still around and presumably working on something, but that knowledge doesn't go anywhere
genetically if they don't have kids again. So, it's lost in terms of permanent lineage, you're basically 
relying on the child to learn along with the parents and then have kids of their own.

Alright, well, I've 100% debunked the idea that genetic memory helps with expanding knowledge (with FACTS 
and LOGIC /s), and I still find it hella cool. So, it must be something else.
