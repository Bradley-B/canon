title: The Tragedy of the Commons

I am unfortunately still on my parents' phone plan with my siblings. 
This, along with the whims of evil telephone corporations, has led to me sharing a limited
amount of mobile data with four other people. 

It's not like we have a tiny data plan. 12gb for five people is totally doable
(it's even marked *XL* by Verizon). 2.4gb per person per month is enough for web browsing
and occasional music streaming. What it is NOT enough for is forgetting that your wifi 
is off and watching netflix for an hour. Which is what my twin sister does every month
with two weeks left in the data cycle.

So there we all are, eleven days left in the data cycle with an empty bucket o' bytes.
The whole situation is really annoying to those of us who pay attention to our
network settings and pace our usage over the month.

When it happened this time - something like the sixth or seventh - it got me thinking about
the problem and the tragedy of the commons.
