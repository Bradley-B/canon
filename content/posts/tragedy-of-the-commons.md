I am still on my parents' phone plan with my siblings.
This, along with the whims of evil telephone corporations, has led to me sharing a limited
amount of mobile data with four other people. 

It's not like we have a tiny data plan. 12gb for five people is totally doable
(it's even marked *XL* by Verizon). 2.4gb per person per month is enough for web browsing
and occasional music streaming. What it is NOT enough for is forgetting that your wifi 
is off and going on tiktok for several hours. Which is what my twin sister does every month
with two weeks left in the data cycle.

So there we all are, halfway through the data cycle with an empty bucket o' bytes.
Of course, my anger is first directed at Verizon, at monopolies, and at capitalism. But
they stopped taking my calls a long time ago. So instead I address my discontent to
the one who uses all the data, to the more immediate source of the problem.

The whole situation is really annoying to those of us who pay attention to our
network settings and pace our usage over the month. When it happened this time -
something like the sixth or seventh - it got me thinking about the problem and
[the tragedy of the commons](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1724745).

The tragedy of the commons is a game theory concept that describes a situation where
individual people who have access to a shared resource will act according to their
own self interest, even when that means harming the resource overall. The individual
gets a short-term gain, but in the end it results in a bad outcome for everyone.

So here the common resource is our mobile data. We would all by happy if everyone
used their allotment and no more, but one individual gets some entertainment for a bit
and then we all suffer. It's an interesting twist that most of the time the usage is
unintentional. I guess this means that the real short-term gain isn't the entertainment
value, but the reduction in cognitive overhead of constantly checking to see if you're
connected to wifi. It seems silly that not doing something so small and automatic is
the true reason for the degradation of the commons.

That's often how it goes, though, right? Small actions build up to something greater.
Picking up your trash is easy and automatic, but some people don't do it. Putting
back your shopping cart is easy and automatic, but some people don't do it.

Of course there are more meaningful examples of the tragedy of the commons. Ones
with bigger consequences. When it's the difference between whether or not you eat that
night, degrading a shared resource seems necessary. I guess we should feel lucky data
isn't like that, and that it resets every month. Mobile data is not resource in the same
way that grazing land is (which is the sort of thing that Hardin was more concerned with). It's
not physical. It's an artificial resource that only exists because of the way we've set
up that particular technology.

I really do recommend reading Hardin's article I linked to before. It's actually really
interesting, and it's only a handful of pages. If you're the type of
person who uses all the data, really, it's the least you can do. Aside from
not using all the data. The rest of us say thanks.
