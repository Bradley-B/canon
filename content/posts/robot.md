I often go out of my way to walk through the mechanical wing of the engineering building. My path takes me 
through this long, straight hallway. The floor is some kind of stone, distinct from the usual carpet or 
tile of other buildings. One wall of the hallway is fairly commonplace. It's an exterior wall, next to a 
small park. Light streams in from floor to ceiling glass windows. The other side of the hallway, however, 
is a bit more unique. Similar windows partition the hallway from what is basically a factory. Blocky
machines dominate the floorspace.

They're used for material processing of some kind, I guess. 3D printers, metal cutters, whatever. I don't 
know. What I do know, is the odor they give that hallway. Because of brain reasons, smells can easily 
trigger detailed memories or intense emotions. For me, this smell is linked to some memories and emotions 
that I certainly don't mind remembering. It's a familiar smell, and one that I used to spend a lot of time 
with. Obviously, this is the smell of my old robotics warehouse.

things to cover here:
- general experience I had in robotics
    - accomplishment from building those robots and working on a team is, like, a lot. idk 
    - uh it's where I learned programming and that I like it
- REV robotics decision
- charlie?
- STS flooding
