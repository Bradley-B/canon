I recently went on [one of my favorite recipe sites](https://www.budgetbytes.com/)
to get the ingredients for [something I make pretty often](https://www.budgetbytes.com/one-pot-beef-mushroom-stroganoff/).
I open the link I have saved in Google Keep - just like always. I scroll past the author's
life story and cooking tips - just like always. I copy the ingredients to my shopping list -
<span style="color: red;">not</span> just like always. Huh? The ingredient list is wrong.
My heart skips a beat as my stomach drops out. Dijon mustard? Worcestershire sauce? What 
the fuck is this shit? My panic rises. I check the url. Is this a different page? Am I having 
a stroke or something? The ingredients are different. Or were they always this way? 
WAS I MAKING IT WRONG THIS WHOLE TIME OH MY GOD

And then I saw it. *updated 5-20-21*. I didn't know whether to feel relief or anger. They
changed the fucking recipe. I feel like I was gaslit by fucking Beth from budget bytes.

The Mushroom Stroganoff Incident is just another symptom of a problem I've been running
into for a while now. We talk about information on the internet as if it'll be around
forever. Parents and teachers echo "be careful what you post online!", but they don't
talk about the other side of the coin. I grew up with the understanding that whatever goes
up on the internet won't come down. Yeah, some things are like that. Embarrassing videos? Sure.
Those can't go away fast enough. What if you're looking for something actually useful, though?
Find it, bookmark it, go back in a few months... might as well have never existed. Dead links
are dead forever. All information is just one cull away from being lost, permanently. 

It's all ephemeral. Everything returns to entropy. Tablets erode, paintings fade, books decay,
and bits un-flip. Unto dust shalt thou return.

I think this is the main advantage of having a time machine. Imagine all the cool-ass shit
we've lost to history that we could finally have back. What happened to the Roanoke Colony?
What happened to D. B. Cooper? Who built stonehenge? And, most importantly,
what happened to my fucking mushroom stroganoff recipe?

Until I get a time machine, I'll do what any reasonable person
would after they've been burned: trust no one. I can't rely on any resource
that I don't control. 

Indeed, that's one of the reasons I made this site. I can at least store my thoughts
here. I can rely on myself, right? As long as I own the domain... and have a hosting provider...
and Github stays up... alright, I admit, the outlook isn't too good. We'll see how it goes.
Only time will tell.
