I recently went on [one of my favorite recipe sites](https://www.budgetbytes.com/)
to get the ingredients for [something I make pretty often](https://www.budgetbytes.com/one-pot-beef-mushroom-stroganoff/).
I open the link I have saved in a Google Keep note - just like always. I scroll past the author's
life story and cooking tips - just like always. I copy the ingredients to my shopping list -
<span style="color: red;">not</span> just like always. Huh? The ingredient list is wrong.
My heart skips a beat. Dijon mustard? Worcestershire sauce? What the fuck is this shit?
I check the url in horror. Is this a different page? Am I having a stroke or something? The ingredients
are different. Or were they always this way? WAS I MAKING IT WRONG THIS WHOLE TIME OH MY GOD

That's when I spot it. *updated 5-20-21*. My panic boils into anger. They changed
the fucking recipe. I feel like I was gaslit by fucking Beth from budget bytes, of all people.
