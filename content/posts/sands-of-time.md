I recently went on [one of my favorite recipe sites](https://www.budgetbytes.com/)
to get the ingredients for [something I make pretty often](https://www.budgetbytes.com/one-pot-beef-mushroom-stroganoff/).
I open the link I have saved in Google Keep - just like always. I scroll past the author's
life story and cooking tips - just like always. I copy the ingredients to my shopping list -
<span style="color: red;">not</span> just like always. Huh? The ingredient list is wrong.
My heart skips a beat as my stomach drops out. Dijon mustard? Worcestershire sauce? What 
the fuck is this shit? I check the url in horror. Is this a different page? Am I having 
a stroke or something? The ingredients are different. Or were they always this way? 
WAS I MAKING IT WRONG THIS WHOLE TIME OH MY GOD

And then I saw it. *updated 5-20-21*. I didn't know whether to feel relief or anger. They
changed the fucking recipe. I feel like I was gaslit by fucking Beth from budget bytes.

The Mushroom Stroganoff Incident is just another symptom of a problem I've been running
into for a while now. We talk about information on the internet as if it'll be around
forever. It was drilled into our heads in middle school - "be careful what you post
online! I'll haunt you!". Sure, some things are like that. That embarrassing
thing you did in high school? That video can't go away fast enough. What if you're looking
for something actually useful, though? Find it, bookmark it, go back in a few months... might
as well have never existed. All information is just one culling away from being lost forever. 

It's all ephemeral. Everything returns to entropy. Tablets erode, paintings fade, books decay,
and bits un-flip. Unto dust shalt thou return.

"So what's the solution?" you might ask. What, to entropy? Sorry. We can't reverse the laws of
physics quite yet. We're trying to come up with mitigations in the short term, though.
The good people at the Internet Archive are making great progress, but they can't hope
to capture *the entire internet*. As for myself, I'll do what any reasonable person
would after they've been burned: trust no one. I can't rely on any resource
that I don't control. 

Indeed, that's one of the reasons I made this site. I can at least store my thoughts
here. I can rely on myself, right? As long as I own the domain... and have a hosting provider...
and Github stays up... alright, I admit, the outlook isn't too good. We'll see how it goes.
Only time will tell.
