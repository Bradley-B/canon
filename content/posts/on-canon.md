The posts on Canon are meant to record what I'm thinking about, and preserve it in case it
happens to be useful. This is great if I can actually translate the feelings in my head to
the right words - but that almost never happens, and certainly not on the first try.
Writing is a labor-intensive process. You need to draw out the phrases with the connotation
you're looking for. The posts here are in my voice and my tone, which means it's easy to not
get it right. To accidentally warp my meaning. Unfortunately, capturing voice is the more
difficult part. The content is less important than the tone, because the tone is what I'm
really trying to preserve. That's the *me* part!

Tone, voice, and thoughts are fleeting, so I need to write them down quickly. When I'm thinking
of a topic, I usually only have a few days before I just forget what I want to say about it.
Sometimes I think of a great way to phrase something, and I only have a minute or two before
I forget it. On the other hand, writing takes time. The recording process is difficult, and 
this is a big issue for Canon. I am currently taking classes and can't always stop to spend
awhile drawing everything out. This means that I often publish a post when it is either incomplete 
or not totally correct. Maybe it says what I want, but not in the best way. It could be better.

What to do? If the purpose of Canon is ...

I tried to mediate the issue with the *Last modified on* text to the top of every post. To show
that it's not the original, raw text. ... The editing process may have mutated the original
feeling. Is that what I want?

The original will always be saved, but not necessarily published. That's the advantage of using
version control for content management. Maybe one of these posts will be about how the blog
technically works (it's really cool). I write posts as code (markdown w/ some metadata), and 
they are tracked with git and hosted on GitHub. I feel this is a good middle ground in between
being customizable and portable. I don't need to write the HTML for every post - it's autogenerated.
For specific posts, I can choose to use custom HTML to do things that markdown can't. Obviously this
makes it less portable, but most of the time I don't use those custom features, so it doesn't matter.

Anyway, the point is that every revision is permanently saved. I can go back and check old versions
of posts at any time. Is that the solution? What if the current content on Canon reflects something
like my current thoughts about the topic? I can change posts at will, because they reflect current
thoughts. The revision history will take care of preserving the way I used to feel about something,
but it just isn't super relevant information anymore, so it isn't displayed front and center.
The issue with this is that it's difficult to be consistent. If I expect all content to reflect
my current thoughts, then I need to periodically update posts when my views change. This is fine
when I have four posts, but could get really annoying if I keep this thing going. It changes the
sort of blog Canon can be. I need to think carefully before adding a post, because each post has
a long-term maintenance cost.

That's not what I'm trying to encourage in myself with this blog.
