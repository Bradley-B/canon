I've been listening to a lot of Lorde lately. I hadn't heard the newer stuff; Solar Power and Melodrama 
are both pretty good. Still, it's hard to beat Pure Heroine. Yeah, it's her most popular album, but even 
still - our appreciation of music is inherently wound up in our experiences with it. Similar to a 
powerful smell, a song or even a simple melody can take you back to a specific place and time. For me, 
Pure Heroine is just comfortable. I remember chatting about it with my sister and feeling validated in my 
music taste. Listening on the bus to school. Writing this while listening on repeat.

Glory and Gore is a favorite on the album. I like the droning progressive background synth, the 
sharp prominent drums, and the edgy lyrics. That description fits a lot of songs. I am not a music 
critic. The part of Glory and Gore that sticks with me the most is the line

> I don't ever think about death <br/>
> It's all right if you do, it's fine

I'm not a gladiator, but I do think about death. A good amount. It's sort of a big deal, all things 
considered. It's one thing to think about it in the abstract -- yes, people die. But stop for an extra 
half second to consider the implications? Try to remember what it was like before you were born. 
It's incorrect to say death is an eternity of nothing. You don't even get to experience the nothing.

Anyway, this means that I'm often looking for meaning about life. Looking for a way to justify the 
painfully short human experience. Unfortunately, I ruled out religion or spirituality a long time ago. 
Instead, I often try to find solace in media written by other humans who are going through the same thing 
that I am. In *The Sirens of Titan*, I like Kurt Vonnegut's

> a purpose of human life, <br/> no matter who is controlling it, <br/> is to love whoever is around to be loved

Even more, in *Hitchhiker's Guide* I like Douglas Adams'

Books are great at telling stories with lessons, but the modern age invites something else. Something 
cooler, with the power to change and evolve, to react to the viewer: games. We're at a unique point in 
human history where a single person or a few people can create a meaningful experience that's seen and 
felt by millions. Some games don't aim for much in terms of affecting change in the player. Among Us is 
about chilling with friends, not having an existential crisis. However, as one of the critical and 
unavoidable human experiences, a lot of games will choose to explore tough topics.

One of those games is a little RPG called Everhood. Everhood is "an ineffable tale of the inexpressible 
divine moments of truth", which is exactly as bizarrely off-the-wall as it sounds. It's (spoiler alert) a 
story about a realm of immortals who have lived, searching for meaning, for eons. It's your responsibility 
as the player to abandon your humanity and kill them to release them from their suffering. What you need to
know is this: Everhood is the perfect blend of witty and charming, yet extremely harrowing. Undertale genre.

Did it help with my fear of death? Decidedly, no. I think it might have made it worse, actually.

### do I want to mention the quotes?

Everhood is absolutely chock-full of sick tunes and awesome quotes, which I say inside my head constantly, 
but none of which I can ever say out loud or else I will sound absolutely batshit insane:

> TONIGHT AND ALL OTHER NIGHTS <br/>
> WE WILL RACE UNTIL THE END OF TIME

> You think you're fighting evil? <br/>
> You are so full of yourself! <br/>
> I AM THE ONE WHO HEARS GOD!!

> Good luck with whatever you are doing!!!

That last one might be okay. Yeah, the quotes don't really make sense without context.
