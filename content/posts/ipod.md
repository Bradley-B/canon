Everyone's got a junk drawer. Somewhere to dump your miscellaneous things at the end of the day when you don't
want to deal with them. Maybe it's right at the entrance to your home, or maybe you hide it shamefully in a
box under your bed. Since I was a kid, I had a junk nightstand at my parent's house. It wasn't meant to be
a junk nightstand. It was meant to be a normal nightstand. I just put junk in it.

Since, like, kindergarten, I put random stuff into it. Mail that should have gone into the trash. Birthday
cards. Baseball cards from my dad. A pack of gum. A paper mache face mask I made in first grade art class.
Cases to DS cartridges long since lost or sold. Tickets to attended sports games. Change. A kazoo. Before 
long, stuff like this filled the drawers. And then, I never cleaned it out. For like 10 years, I just left 
it in there, occasionally adding some new junk. I left, went to college, and it sat untouched. Random 
childhood memories, contained and undisturbed, like a time capsule. Until yesterday, when I went in with a 
trash bag and threw (almost) all of it out.

It was interesting to look through. I love getting data about myself, and physical trash is, really, more 
data. In the same way historians learn about ancient societies by their trash, I can learn about my past 
self. But, at some point, it just needs to go to the landfill. It would be nice to reclaim that nightstand 
for actual use.

Along my adventures through childhood rubble, I came across my old 7th gen ipod nano - the last nano Apple 
ever made. Previously, I considered this piece of tech long-lost to the sands of time. I had actually spent 
some time looking for it, but was previously unsuccessful. You see, it contains information about my music
preferences from 2014-2015, before I got my first smartphone and started using streaming services. 
Additionally, I planned to really use it. It holds up remarkably well to this day - enough to daily 
drive if you need a small and light mp3 player. It has bluetooth, and my recent earbuds and headphones 
connect and play music without much fuss, save for a few volume quirks.

Unfortunately, it doesn't have an internet connection. This means that you need to plug it into a computer
and drag-and-drop mp3 files on it like they did in caveman times. I see this as both a drawback and a 
benefit. It's inconvenient to put music on it, sure, but once the music is there, it's not going anywhere
unless you remove it (obviously flash storage degrades, but that can be mitigated). You aren't bound to an 
app, or a third-party service. Mp3 players are a timeless, cohesive package. Doing one thing and doing it 
well. That's an attractive quality.

With this in mind, I set out to make it easier to get mp3 files to put on the ipod.
