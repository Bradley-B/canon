It's kinda cool how adaptable people are. It's been awhile since my last day at
[Validity](https://www.validity.com/), and I'm unfortunately back to taking classes.

But not for long.

At this point in my career, there are pretty regular large shifts in the way I live my life.
I go from taking classes and studying, to doing nothing, to an internship, to classes again.
This is common to all college students, I guess. When you need to complete a couple co-ops to 
get your degree, it happens more. There are more types of things to switch between, and you
switch between them for longer. The two-year segment of my life I'm in right now
looks like this: 

<pre>
                              we are here â¬‡
Classes âž¡ Break âž¡ Classes âž¡ Co-op âž¡ <span style="color: red;">Classes</span> âž¡ Co-op âž¡ Classes (2x) âž¡ Graduation
</pre>

As you can see, I live and die by the semester schedule. Half a year of classes, a break, more
classes, and a co-op ðŸ™‚, before the semester schedule rears its ugly head and calls me back 
to Rochester. Time waits for no man. I always really notice the snap between frames of mind 
and workflows when I move to the next section. When I started at Validity, I remember commenting
about how quickly I fit into the role. A quick and painless transition from sheltered classes to the
big bad real world. On reflection, I think that this is mostly just a human thing rather than 
specific to the situation.

Admittedly, I think I tend to over-generalize my experiences. It's difficult to know which
things are human things vs. which things are me things. I really only have one complete data
point, me. I can try to speculate about other people, but I will never understand them
as well as I understand myself. If that's the case, then I might just have my education to credit.
People aren't that good at adapting, I'm just a good software engineer.

Nah.

I can imagine a world where people are less adaptable, and these changes totally break
mental health and cause people to shut down. Thankfully, this is the exception and not
the rule. I really like the segments and dividing lines of the co-op schedule, and I suspect
most people enjoy it as much as I do. It provides nice clean breaks for dedicated retrospection,
and the ability to write pretentious postmortems.

Anyway. It's been a month since the last clean break, and I feel like I've had enough processing
time (too much, maybe) about the co-op segment to write a decent postmortem of my experience.
So here goes.

## Here Goes

My biggest takeaway from the internship was definitely confidence. Turns out, professional
software engineering isn't some mythical occupation reserved for elite MIT grads
with 200 IQs. It's really the same point I made about adaptability. I got my environment
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H5uWRjFsGc" className="no-style">
set up, was knocked down, then got up again</a> and I was on a roll. Same process as
my classes and personal projects, except now I was being paid to do it. Score!

Before you've done something for the first time, you don't know how difficult it will be, 
or that you can do it at all. On realizing you can do it, you get a big confidence boost
from the assurance. Maybe this is why it feels similar to the first time I dated someone.
I found that both times I got a big boost in self-confidence and validation. Someone else
likes you enough to date. Someone else likes you enough to hire.

Notably, it was NOT the same feeling as being dropped off at college. That was awhile ago now,
but I definitely still remember how it felt - I don't think that's the sort of thing you forget.
I thought that it might be the same feeling because they both have to do with being dropped
into completely new situations. However, the 'drop off at college' experience is missing the
feedback loop that provides validation. The feedback doesn't come until several months later
after the first semester of classes. *Then* the chain catches and the feedback kicks in.

...

Do you know that feeling like you've forgotten something important? Oh, right. I was supposed
to be talking about Validity.
