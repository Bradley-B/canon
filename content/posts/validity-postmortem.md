It's kinda cool how adaptable people are. It's been awhile since my last day at
[Validity](https://www.validity.com/), and I'm unfortunately back to taking classes.

But not for long.

At this point in my career, there are pretty regular large shifts in the way I live my life.
I go from taking classes and studying, to doing nothing, to an internship, to classes again.
This is common to all college students, I guess. When you need to complete a couple co-ops to 
get your degree, it happens more. There are more types of things to switch between, and you
switch between them for longer. The two-year segment of my life I'm in right now
looks like this: 

<pre>
                              we are here â¬‡
Classes âž¡ Break âž¡ Classes âž¡ Co-op âž¡ <span style="color: red;">Classes</span> âž¡ Co-op âž¡ Classes (2x) âž¡ Graduation
</pre>

As you can see, I live and die by the semester schedule. Half a year of classes, a break, more
classes, and a co-op ðŸ™‚, before the semester schedule rears its ugly head and calls me back 
to Rochester. I always really notice the snap between frames of mind and workflows when I 
move to the next section. When I started at Validity, I remember commenting about how quickly
I fit into the role. A quick and painless transition from sheltered classes to the big bad 
real world. On reflection, I think that this is mostly just a human thing rather than specific to
the situation.

I can imagine a world where people are less adaptable, and these changes
totally break mental health and cause people to shut down. Thankfully, this is the exception
and not the rule. I really like the segments and dividing lines, and I suspect most people enjoy 
it as much as I do. It provides nice clean breaks for dedicated retrospection, and the ability 
to write pretentious postmortems.

Anyway. It's been a month since the last clean break, and I feel like I've had enough processing
time (too much, maybe) about the co-op segment to write a decent postmortem of my experience.
So here goes.

One of my favorite Youtube personalities, Matt Parker, has a line in one of his 
videos where he says something like 'the human brain is great, you can cheat by
just learning how to do something'.

When I'm trying to figure out which things are human things vs. which things are me things,
I definitely risk over-generalization. I really only have one complete data point, myself.
I can try to gather information about other people, but I will never understand them
as well as I understand myself.
